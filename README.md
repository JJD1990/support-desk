# support-desk

Using React and NodeJs i have been able to successfully build a support ticketing system which can be found here:
https://jjdsupport-desk.herokuapp.com/

This is based on a Brad Traversy Project within the React Front To Back Course. 

It is a full stack application with a React frontend and Node backend, the app allows you to register as a user, add, update and delete tickets and
notes on those tickets. 

Whilst making this project I learnt more about Redux, State, MongoDB, useEffect and user authentication.
